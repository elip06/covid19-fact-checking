The fine-tuning of the Transformer models was executed using Google's Colab GPUs.  
Record of the runs can be found in the following 3 W&B projects: 
- [Model Comparison](https://wandb.ai/elip06/model-comparison)
- [Cross Validation](https://wandb.ai/elip06/cross-validation)
- [Hyperparameter Tuning for DistilBERT](https://wandb.ai/elip06/distilbert-hyperparameter-tuning/sweeps/s3movirv)
